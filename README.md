# consolesweeper
Minesweeper written in Rust for playing in console.

Hit the pillow one night and my brain went into overdrive about how I could represent a minesweeper field with a single byte for all info about a cell.\
Decided to take it as a challenge to also create an entire program using vim.\
Needless to say, it's a bit messy but it works.
